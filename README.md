The application will leverage the JavaScript Leaflet library for map rendering and the Geolocation API for obtaining user location.

Features:

1. Map Display:
  Utilize the Leaflet library to display an interactive map.
  Set an initial map view centered on the user's current location.

  When submitting the form, mark the workout location on the map.

4. Workout Markers:
  Represent each logged workout on the map with a marker.
  Clicking on a marker should display workout details in a popup.

5. History and Filter:
